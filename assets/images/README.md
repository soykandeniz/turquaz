# Turquaz Image Mapping

Replace the placeholder image files referenced by the landing page with your own high-quality photography.

Required filenames:

- `hero.jpeg` — Fullscreen hero shot (prefer interior or signature plating, cinematic crop)
- `about-interior.jpeg` — About section visual
- `dish-feature.jpeg` — Large featured signature dish
- `dish-1.jpeg`
- `dish-2.jpeg`
- `dish-3.jpeg`
- `chef-portrait.jpeg` — Dramatic chef portrait
- `gallery-1.jpeg` to `gallery-6.jpeg` — Interior and atmosphere series

Tips:

- Use large images (minimum 2200px wide for hero / feature assets)
- Keep color grading consistent toward deep turquoise, warm ivory, and matte gold highlights
- Favor atmospheric lighting and negative space for editorial composition
